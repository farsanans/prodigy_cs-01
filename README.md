Caeser Cipher
Encryption and Decryption of messages using Caesar Cypher algorithm.
This repository contains a a python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm and also, allow users to input a message and shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

How It Works
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features
Encrypts a given text with a specified shift value.
Decrypts a given text with the original shift value.
